# Workout Droid
A daily-total-based workout motivator. 

# Usage
Tell the droid that you want to do a `total` of 1000 push-ups in a day, and it will remind you at regular `intervals` throughout the day to do a `new set` of push-ups until you've completed your `total`.

Set `hard dead-zones` in advance or on the fly so you don't get reminded to do push-ups in the car or at a meeting. Use `soft dead-zones` to complete `pending sets` or give yourself a break if you're already caught up.
